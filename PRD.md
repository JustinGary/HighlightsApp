+# Intelligent Highlights Management Application PRD
+
+## 1. Product Overview
+The Intelligent Highlights Management Application is a knowledge retention platform that imports Kindle highlights and custom notes, organizes them into thematic collections, and delivers weekly spaced-repetition-based email digests. It is positioned as an alternative to Readwise with a focus on adaptive learning and personalized retention strategies.
+
+## 2. Goals & Success Metrics
+- **Primary Goal:** Increase long-term knowledge retention for readers by resurfacing saved highlights at optimal intervals.
+- **Secondary Goals:**
+  - Provide a frictionless workflow for ingesting Kindle highlights and manual notes.
+  - Deliver actionable, concise weekly email digests that encourage review and reflection.
+  - Offer analytics on reading activity and retention effectiveness.
+- **Success Metrics:**
+  - Import completion rate (percentage of Kindle highlights successfully ingested per user per week).
+  - Weekly digest open and click-through rates.
+  - Retention score improvement (self-reported or quiz-based).
+  - User retention (weekly active users) after 4 and 12 weeks.
+
+## 3. Target Users & Personas
+- **Knowledge Curator:** A voracious reader who wants to centralize highlights across books, blogs, and personal notes.
+- **Professional Learner:** A knowledge worker who uses highlights for ongoing training and needs reminders to revisit key concepts.
+- **Lifelong Learner:** An enthusiast engaging in self-guided learning who values spaced repetition to reinforce memory.
+
+## 4. User Stories
+1. As a user, I can connect my Kindle account or upload highlight exports so that my reading data is automatically imported.
+2. As a user, I can add custom notes manually or via integrations (web clipper, email forwarding) so that non-Kindle content is captured.
+3. As a user, I receive weekly email digests that surface highlights I am likely to forget soon.
+4. As a user, I can rate or snooze resurfaced highlights to adjust future scheduling.
+5. As a user, I can search and filter my library by book, topic, or tag for quick retrieval.
+6. As a user, I can review analytics showing which highlights I have mastered or need to revisit.
+7. As an admin, I can monitor import jobs, email delivery status, and system health.
+
+## 5. Functional Requirements
+### 5.1 Imports & Capture
+- Support Kindle highlight ingestion via Amazon export files and API (if available).
+- Allow CSV, HTML, and JSON highlight imports; deduplicate based on content and source.
+- Enable manual note creation with tagging and source attribution.
+- Provide optional browser extension or API endpoints for third-party capture (phase 2).
+
+### 5.2 Organization & Metadata
+- Auto-tag highlights based on book metadata, topics (using NLP classification), and user-defined tags.
+- Allow creation of collections or notebooks for grouping related highlights.
+- Track metadata: source title, author, location, captured date, tags, last reviewed date, mastery score.
+
+### 5.3 Spaced Repetition Engine
+- Assign each highlight to a review schedule using an evidence-based spaced repetition algorithm (e.g., SM-2 variant).
+- Update the schedule based on user feedback (e.g., "Still Fresh", "Needs Review", "Forgot") and revisit history.
+- Maintain per-user state so that review intervals adapt to individual performance.
+
+### 5.4 Weekly Digest Emails
+- Generate personalized weekly email digests summarizing:
+  - Highlights due for review, prioritized by forgetting likelihood.
+  - New highlights added in the past week.
+  - Suggested actions (rate, tag, archive).
+- Provide responsive HTML email templates with fallback plain-text.
+- Track opens, clicks, and snoozes to feed back into the learning model.
+
+### 5.5 Web & Mobile Experience
+- Dashboard summarizing review queue, streaks, and reading stats.
+- Highlight detail view with context, notes, related items, and mastery indicators.
+- Search and filter interface with full-text search and tag facets.
+- Mobile-responsive design with offline-friendly reading list (phase 2).
+
+### 5.6 Analytics & Reporting
+- Personal analytics: review completion rate, retention trends, import volume.
+- System analytics: import job status, email delivery metrics, spaced repetition performance.
+- Export capabilities (CSV/JSON) for personal backups.
+
+### 5.7 Administration & Support
+- Admin console for managing user accounts, integrations, and monitoring queues.
+- Alerting for failed imports, email delivery issues, and processing backlogs.
+- Role-based access control for internal support staff.
+
+## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
+- **Security:** OAuth-based authentication, encryption at rest and in transit, GDPR compliance for EU users.
+- **Scalability:** Handle thousands of users, each with tens of thousands of highlights; import jobs should scale via worker queues.
+- **Reliability:** 99.5% monthly uptime target; digest generation should degrade gracefully if some imports fail.
+- **Performance:** Imports processed within 5 minutes for 95% of files <10MB; digest emails generated within 10 minutes of schedule.
+- **Privacy:** Provide data deletion/export capabilities and clear consent for email communications.
+
+## 7. System Architecture Overview
+- **Frontend:** React (web) + optional React Native (mobile) consuming GraphQL/REST API.
+- **Backend:** Node.js or Python service with modular architecture handling imports, scheduling, notifications, and analytics.
+- **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL for relational data, S3-compatible storage for raw exports, Redis for queues/caching, optional vector store for semantic search.
+- **Integrations:** Kindle import adapters, email delivery service (e.g., SendGrid), authentication provider (e.g., Auth0), analytics pipeline (e.g., Segment + warehouse).
+- **Processing:** Background workers for import parsing and spaced repetition scheduling (e.g., Celery or BullMQ).
+
+## 8. Data Model (High-Level)
+- **User:** profile, preferences, notification settings.
+- **Source:** metadata about books, articles, or notes.
+- **Highlight:** text, location, source reference, tags, captured_at, last_reviewed_at, mastery_score.
+- **ReviewEvent:** timestamp, rating, device, notes.
+- **Digest:** generated_at, sent_at, delivery_status, metrics.
+- **IntegrationJob:** status, failure_reason, payload metadata.
+
+## 9. Spaced Repetition Logic
+- Use SM-2 baseline parameters with adjustable ease factor per highlight.
+- Convert user feedback ratings into interval adjustments; high confidence extends the interval, low confidence shortens it.
+- Allow manual override of schedule for critical highlights.
+- Store training data for future ML-driven personalization.
+
+## 10. Email Digest Experience
+- Weekly cadence (user-adjustable) with send time personalization based on historical engagement.
+- Include quick actions (rate, snooze, archive) directly in email via authenticated links.
+- Provide summary of upcoming reviews and motivational insights (streaks, top themes).
+- Localize email content for major markets in phase 3.
+
+## 11. Analytics & Insights
+- Track highlight review outcomes to compute retention probability over time.
+- Provide trend charts on reading topics, review consistency, and top sources.
+- Offer "insight cards" summarizing key learnings or resurfaced connections.
+
+## 12. Risks & Mitigations
+- **Import Limitations:** Kindle API constraints; mitigate with manual export support and scheduled manual uploads.
+- **Email Fatigue:** Users may unsubscribe; mitigate with customizable frequency and digest preview on web.
+- **Data Privacy:** Sensitive highlight content; mitigate with encryption, anonymization for analytics, and clear policies.
+- **Algorithm Trust:** Users may distrust automation; mitigate with transparency on schedule logic and allow manual controls.
+
+## 13. Launch Plan & Milestones
+1. **MVP (Weeks 1-8):** Kindle import via file upload, manual notes, basic spaced repetition, weekly email digest, core dashboard.
+2. **Beta (Weeks 9-16):** Analytics dashboard, advanced tagging, improved email personalization, public waitlist.
+3. **GA (Weeks 17-24):** Integrations (browser extension, API), mobile app beta, localization groundwork, billing.
+
+## 14. Open Questions
+- Availability and compliance considerations for Kindle API access?
+- Preferred pricing model (subscription tiers vs. usage-based)?
+- Should we introduce collaborative features (shared collections) in future phases?
+- How to incorporate AI-generated summaries without diluting original highlights?
